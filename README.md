# OLS-Response Correctness (Stand-alone Version)

This standalone module is designed for testing and validating the correctness of responses generated by the OLS . Ensure that you follow the prerequisites before running the tests.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure the OLS is operational on port 8080. Future versions will allow dynamic port configuration.
- Docker must be installed and running. Support for Podman is planned for upcoming releases.

## Running the Tests
1. **Prepare Test Prompts**: Define your test prompts and the expected response types. Use the provided `prompts.json` as a reference template.
2. **Execute the Test Script**: Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python basic-e2e-kubeconform.py

This script will process the prompts and generate responses.

## Results

Upon completion, a validation_report.json file will be generated. This file contains detailed results for each prompt, including their respective validations.
